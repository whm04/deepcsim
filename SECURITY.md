## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: **mzaliwahib04@gmail.com**.
 
Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I will review the report carefully and respond as quickly as possible.
